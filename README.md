## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned elementary of semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, flexbox, grid, media queries, optimal layout depending on device's screen size, hover and focus states for interactive elements:

```html
     <button>
          <a href="#" target="_blank" class="proceed-payment"><h3>Proceed to Payment</h3></a>
      </button>
```
```css
button {
    background-color: var(--bright-blue); 
    border-color: var(--bright-blue);
    box-shadow: 2px 2px 8px var(--desaturated-blue);
    color: var(--very-pale-blue);
    font-weight:400; 
    padding:0 4rem; 
    border-radius: 1rem;
    width: 100%;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: var(--medium-slate-blue);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts still not completely comfortable with or techniques  found useful that  want to refine and perfect.
